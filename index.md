### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because it was one of the first assignments
    that we did in class. It showed me the basics of coding and how to turn farenheit into celcius. It was a simple task that put my brain to work.



* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because I was curious on how we were gonna make a sandwhich inside of a computer. It allowed to make cin and cout statements to put together a sandwhich. It also displayed what the sandwhich had in it. 



* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious on how to do conversions
    with decimals. I was able to write functions for the first time that would allow me to convert decimal feet into inches.
